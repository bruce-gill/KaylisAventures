        <h1>Covid is NO joke</h1>
        Beautiful week everyone! 
        <br /><br />
        Bruce and I got slammed with covid. Thursday night I was getting sicker and sicker, Friday morning I woke up and realized I couldn't taste anything.... Thankfully we got one Covid test from Bruce's workplace and because I was the sicker one, I got tested. What do you know? I have Covid, we weren't able to get Bruce tested but as my fever has gone down, his is starting to rise! Pray for us! Thank you Mom and Dad (Hollie and David) for looking out for us when we had low soup stores!
        <br /><br />
        Regardless of how much this sucks (body aches, headaches, fever, sore throat, painful coughing, and on and on) we have been TREMENDOUSLY blessed and these are in the ways that we have only counted:
            
        <ul>
            <li>
                Bruce just started his internship in which he can work from online and his job provided the free covid test
            </li>
            <li>
                This exact weekend is a 3 day weekend, due to the holiday on Monday. Which means that we will be missing less school than we would!
            </li>
            <li>
                The weather has been very cold, but recently it has warmed up so that Bruce and I can open the windows to let fresh air in and the sick air out. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Just the week before, due to the Covid spike, our bishop had given the ward permission to perform the sacrament in our home, so we were able to have our own humble sacrament. I am so grateful that Bruce is worthy to perform that for us, with his 101 degree temperature. He is so special.
            </li>
            <li>
                We finished our 3-6 month emergency fund! We are going to be okay, if for some reason we need to tap into it.
            </li>    
            <li>    
                Professors have been more than understanding, mine especially.
            </li>
            <li>
                We have been sick together, while the others' temperature soars, the others have been normal. So we can take care of each other.
            </li>
            <li>    
                We were vaccinated.
            </li>    
        </ul>
        These are just the things that we have counted! That last one might be a curious one. "We were vaccinated," but you still got it! Yeah, we still got it, but I can not imagine what it would have been like without a vaccination. If we can, after this, we are totally getting a booster, because Covid bites. 
            
        <br /><br />
        We have been so tremendously blessed in this. God is so good! The Lord will take us through it. 
        <br /><br />
        That is something I am learning, because something happens does not mean we are forsaken. It means that we have to look beyond ourselves and see what the Lord is doing for us! I have been careful to not get it, especially with the rising spike, but I still got it! I have been able to see witnesses of how much the Lord loves and blesses Bruce and I.
        <br /><br />
        The dishes are piled up, the apartment is a mess, but that doesn't matter because the Lord will take us through it.
        <br /><br />
        We love you all,
        We pray that you will stay safe and careful.
        <br /><br />
        Bruce & Kayli

        P.S. Put little Collin Lowe in your prayers! I worry I got him sick! He is such a sweetheart.
