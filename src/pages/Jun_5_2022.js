       Family,
        <br /><br />
        We love you very much and think about you often! 
        <br /><br />
        Bruce has given me a way to start my testimony (insert kid voice): "I would like to bear my testimony. I know the Church is true. I wub (love) my family and know they love me."
        <br /><br />
        But it is true! I have a testimony and sometimes I do not feel that it is particularly strengthened but that it is growing and changing bit by bit. 
        <br /><br />
        I know that the Church is true! Not for the people, not for the organization but for Who leads and guides it! I know that the Church is true, because Jesus Christ is at the head!
        <br /><br />
        Maybe not a testimony, but I love my family and I know that they love me! That does not mean we get along all the time but it means that we are willing to forgive and move on. We are good at that! We do not hold grudges, because we have been taught that is not the Savior's way.
        <br /><br />
        Most importantly, Jesus Christ is my Savior. I am learning who He is everyday and I am trying to be what He wants me to be. He knows me. Wow. In a lot of ways that feels embarrassing, I am imperfect, I feel shame and guilt far too often, and He knows all of that. Yikes. But with Him that never is the end. He takes all of that and will take all of that and mold it into something better, something divine. He is the Healer, the Lamb, the Prince of Peace. To come to know Him is a gift that we all can have. 
        <br /><br />
        We love you, again!
        <br />
        Hang in there, you are doing great!
        <br /><br />
        Bruce & Kayli
