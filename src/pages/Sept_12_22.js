        <h1>BYU Downs Baylor, Kayli tries to keep down anything and everything</h1>
        Hello family!
        <br />
        <br />
        I did not email yesterday, because 1, I was tired and 2, I forgot. Eh, it happens!
        <br />
        <br />
        Bruce and I had a very very exciting Saturday night watching BYU take down Baylor in the football stadium! My ears are still recovering. 
        Bruce's voice also paid a price as he was cheering for the both of us. We were among a crowd of 63,740; sold out and loud, forcing Baylor into 4 false starts. 
        <br />
        <br />
        It was the first game that we have been to this year and it was a great date night.
        <br />
        <br />
        For the other part of the subject line (ahem... yes, me), I got a really good bawl in today. 
        Pregnancy is so so so so so (times infinity) SO hard. All you mothers are CHAMPS! I have been praying and praying, Bruce is doing his best to help me, 
        and it still is so difficult. I often feel that I am walking on eggshells. Throwing up sucks, every muscle and bone in my body aches. 
        <br /><br />
        [Months ago, Bruce and I attended a fireside discussing symbolism and the number 40 was symbolic of consecration through suffering. 
        fasted for 40 days, the Israelites wandered for 40 years, and pregnancy is 40 weeks. Doesn't that feel validating, mothers? And what a beautiful symbol!]
        <br /><br />
        However, I do not moan and whine just because (though never underestimate the power of a good cry). I want to testify of the power of prayer and 
        acknowledge the importance of surrounding yourself with supportive, loving people. I KNOW my prayers are heard. Heavenly Father will help me bring this baby into the world. 
        He will ease my anxiety and soothe my fears. Bruce, the beautiful, kind, gentle husband that he is, will always be there to hold my hair when I am hunched over the toilet. 
        Then he will hold me and let me cry afterward. When it is needed, help is there!
        <br /><br />
        I am so grateful for the peace that this gospel affords. With the exciting and scary changes we have been experiencing, there is nothing sweeter than calm and stillness. 
        <br /><br />
        Another part of that, I felt I should throw in, is the power of the Book of Mormon! I read it every morning and I gain so much strength. 
        It is on this earth for us! What a beautiful blessing. 
        <br /><br />
        I have yet to have a solid testimony of the Come Follow Me curriculum, but I want to include it as well! In our sacrament meeting, 
        a couple spoke on Come Follow Me and the difference it has made in their lives. I felt the Spirit! Bruce and I try our best to do it every night, 
        but it has been far from consistent. I feel renewed in continuing to try. The worst it can do is add more light to our lives!
        <br /><br />
        Anyways, we love you all and do our best to pray for each and everyone one of you by name. You are all so special to us! 
        <br /><br />
        Love,
        <br /><br />
        Bruce & Kayli & Bean
